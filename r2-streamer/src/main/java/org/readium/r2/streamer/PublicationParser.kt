     * - support content protection technologies
     * - parse exploded archives or in archiving formats unknown to the parser, e.g. RAR

     * but some formats might not have a way of declaring a title.
     * In which case, fallbackTitle will be used.
     * @param warnings used to broadcast non-fatal parsing warnings.
     * Can be used to report publication authoring mistakes,
     * to warn users of potential rendering issues or help authors debug their publications.
